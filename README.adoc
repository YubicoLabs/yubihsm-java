== JAVA YubiHSM

Java-yubihsm is a java library used to interact with a YubiHSM 2 device

=== Compilation

To compile from source, run

    $ ./gradlew build

This will automatically run all tests after compilation. To compile without running tests, run

    $ ./gradlew build -x test -x integrationTest

=== Tests

There are three test sets in this library, one for unit tests, one for integration tests and one for
the device options test.

==== Unit Tests

To run all unit tests, run:

    $ gradle clean test

To run one unit test, run

    $ gradle test -Dtest.single=<TEST NAME>

==== Integrations Tests

The integration tests assume that the YubiHSM contains the default authentication key, which is an
 authentication key with Object ID `1`, password `password` and alla capabilities and delegated
 capabilities. Some tests will reset the device so all objects contained in the device will be
 deleted.

The integration tests also assume that the YubiHSM is accessible via the URL `http://localhost:12345/connector/api`

To run all integration tests, run

    $ gradle clean integrationTest

To run one integration test, run

    $ gradle integrationTest -Dtest.single=<TEST NAME>

Running all integration tests can take 10-15 minutes

==== Device Options Test

The device options test changes the audit log settings on the device. When run with the other tests,
it will cause the log to fill quickly and all tests failing because of it. That is why this test is
run is its own test set.

To run the device options test, run

     $ gradle clean optionsTest

Or

      $ gradle optionsTest -Dtest.single=OptionsTest
